---------

* Chart of Accounts and Taxes template for companies in Japan.
* This probably does not cover all the necessary accounts for a company. You are expected to add/delete/modify accounts based on this template.

Note:
-----

* Fiscal positions '内税' and '外税' have been added to handle special requirements which might arise from POS implementation. [1]  Under normal circumstances, you might not need to use those at all.

        with pain.008.001.02 specification) to send to your bank in order to
        collect a set of payments.

        To be elligible for this payment method, a customer must have first
        returned a mandate to the company, giving his consent to use direct debit.
        This consent must have been encoded as a 'customer mandate' into Odoo.

        You also need to meet the following requirements in order to properly
        generate a SDD file:
        - Your company account must be set to a valid IBAN number
        - Your company must have been given a creditor identifier (this can be done in the 'settings' menu of the accounting module)
        - Your company must have defined a journal to receive SDD payments (again, in 'settings' of accounting module)
        - Every customer for which you generate a payment must have a valid IBAN account number.

        Odoo will let you know if any of these requirements are not satisfied.

        Any invoice that gets validated for a customer with a mandate will be
        automatically set in 'paid' state, and a payment will be generated. An
        option in the dashboard will then allow you to view all the payments generated
        via SDD and to generate a XML collection file for them, grouping them as
        you see fit.

        A dedicated 'SEPA Direct Debit' payment method is also available for
        open invoices, when selecting a bank account in the 'register payment' wizard.
        Use it to generate a SDD payment for the invoices if you added a mandate
        for its owner after its validation. You will see an error message if you
        try to use this method on an invoice for whose payment no mandate can be used.

    Summary: all seller-provided discounts must be applied to the Sales Price before calculating sales tax.
    Sellers should disclose their methodology to customers in a Discount Application Policy.

    The algorithm is as follows:
     - line-specific discounts are applied first, on the lines they are supposed to apply to.
       This means product-specific discounts or discounts on the cheapest line.
     - Then global discounts are applied evenly across paid lines, as much as possible.
       If there is a remainder, it is applied sequentially, in the order of the lines,
       until there is either no discount left or no discountable line left.

    Note that discount lines (with a negative price) will have no taxes applied to them,
    but rather the amount of these lines will be deduced from the lines they apply to during tax computation.

ABA Credit Transfer
===================

This module allows the generation of payment batches as ABA (Australian
Bankers Association) text files.  The generated 'aba' file can be uploaded
to many Australian banks.

Setup
-----

- *Account > Configuration > invoicing > Journals*

    If needed, create new journal or choose an existing journal with **Type**
    set to *“Bank”*.

    On **Advanced Settings**, ensure ABA Credit Transfer is ticked.

    On the **Bank Account** tab, enter the **Account Number**.

    On the same tab, ensure the ABA transfer information is set up.

    **BSB** - Required, 6 digits, and will be auto formatted.

    **Financial Institution Code** - Required (provided by bank or can be found
    on Google).  It is three uppercase 3 characters.

    **Supplying User Name** - Some banks allow this to be freeform, some banks
    may reject the ABA file if the Supplying User Name is not as expected.  It
    cannot be longer than 26 characters.

    **APCA Identification Number** - User Identification number is bank
    allocated.  It is 6 digits.

    **Include Self Balancing Transaction** - Some institutions require that the
    last be a self balancing transaction which is used as a verification.

- *Accounting > Configuration > Payments > Bank Accounts*

    Account will show up in list as the journal name.

    Editing will show the **Account Number**.  This is important as it is used by
    the ABA process.

    **Bank** is optional.

- *Contacts > Configuration > Bank Accounts > Bank Accounts*

    Paying account will show up in list as the account number.

    **Account Holder Name** - Can be entered here, if Required.  Generally not
    validated by the banks on ABA file transfers, but may show up on the payee
    bank statement against the payment.

- Vendor bank accounts can be set up in the same place, however, it is
  generally easier to set them up from the partner from for the Vendor.

- *Accounting > Vendors > Vendors*

    On **Accounting** tab, click on *""View accounts detail""* from where a
    vendor bank account can be created or edited.

    **Account Number** - Required, must be less than 9 digits.

    **BSB** - Required, 6 digits, and will be auto formatted.

    **Account Holder Name** - Optional.

Use
---

- Create a vendor payment in the normal way.

    Ensure the **Vendor** is one with a valid ABA payment account.

    Choose the correct **Payment Journal** which is set for ABA payments.

    Select **ABA Credit Transfer** radio button.

    If the vendor has multiple bank account, you may need to select the
    correct **Recipient Bank Account**.  Or if paying a vendor bill, it may
    need the correct bank account associated with it.

    Enter payment amount, etc.

- *Vendors > Payments*

    After payment(s) are confirmed, they will show up in the payments list.

    Using filters, or sorting, select the payments to be included.  Under
    *Actions* choose *Create batch payment*.

- *Vendors > Batch Payments*

    When validating a batch payment, the ABA file will be generated.  It can
    be regenerated.  This file can then be uploaded to the bank.

Add a new model named ""Identification Type"" that extend the vat field functionality in the partner and let the user to identify (an eventually invoice) to contacts not only with their fiscal tax ID (VAT) but with other types of identifications like national document, passport, foreign ID, etc. With this module installed you will see now in the partner form view two fields:

* Identification Type
* Identification Number

This behavior is a common requirement for some latam countries like Argentina and Chile. If your localization has this requirements then you need to depend on this module and define in your localization module the identifications types that are used in your country. Generally these types of identifications are defined by the government authorities that regulate the fiscal operations. For example:

* AFIP in Argentina defines DNI, CUIT (vat for legal entities), CUIL (vat for natural person), and another 80 valid identification types.

Each identification holds this information:

* name: short name of the identification
* description: could be the same short name or a long name
* country_id: the country where this identification belongs
* is_vat: identify this record as the corresponding VAT for the specific country.
* sequence: let us to sort the identification types depending on the ones that are most used.
* active: we can activate/inactivate identifications to make it easier to our customers

In order to make this module compatible for multi-company environments where we have companies that does not need/support this requirement, we have added generic identification types and generic rules to manage the contact information and make it transparent for the user when only use the VAT as we formerly know.

Generic Identifications:

* VAT: The Fiscal Tax Identification or VAT number, by default will be selected as identification type so the user will only need to add the related vat number.
* Passport
* Foreign ID (Foreign National Document)

Rules when creating a new partner: We will only see the identification types that are meaningful, taking into account these rules:

* If the partner have not country address set: Will show the generic identification types plus the ones defined in the partner's related company country (If the partner has not specific company then will show the identification types related to the current user company)

* If the partner has country address : will show the generic identification types plus the ones defined for the country of the partner.

When creating a new company, will set to the related partner always the related country is_vat identification type.

All the defined identification types can be reviewed and activate/deactivate in ""Contacts / Configuration / Identification Type"" menu.

This module is compatible with base_vat module in order to be able to validate VAT numbers for each country that have or not have the possibility to manage multiple identification types.

Taxable Payments Annual Reports (TPAR) for Australia

The Taxable payments annual report (TPAR) allows:

    • Payments made to contractors (or subcontractors) for services, or
    • Grants paid by government entities to ABN holders

to be reported where required under the Taxable Payments Reporting System (TPRS) and the Taxable Government Grants and Payments reporting measure.

The TPAR is due by 28th August each year.

Penalties may apply if you don’t lodge your TPAR on time.

For further information on who is required to lodge a Taxable payments annual report refer to
https://softwaredevelopers.ato.gov.au/tprs

The annual report must be provided to the Commissioner no later than 28 August after the end of the financial year. Reports can be sent more frequently for those that wish to do so.

The report uses tax tags ``Service`` and ``Tax Withheld`` in order to find adequate journal items. These are set using the fiscal positions, and the right type of product (Services).

Base module for the Brazilian localization
==========================================

This module consists of:

 - Generic Brazilian chart of accounts
 - Brazilian taxes such as:

        - IPI
        - ICMS
        - PIS
        - COFINS
        - ISS
        - IR
        - IRPJ
        - CSLL

The field tax_discount has also been added in the account.tax.template and 
account.tax objects to allow the proper computation of some Brazilian VATs 
such as ICMS. The chart of account creation wizard has been extended to 
propagate those new data properly.

It's important to note however that this module lack many implementations to 
use Odoo properly in Brazil. Those implementations (such as the electronic 
fiscal Invoicing which is already operational) are brought by more than 15 
additional modules of the Brazilian Launchpad localization project 
https://launchpad.net/openerp.pt-br-localiz and their dependencies in the 
extra addons branch. Those modules aim at not breaking with the remarkable 
Odoo modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the 
reasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization 
leaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies 
fund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers, 
accounting SPED, fiscal SPED and PAF ECF that are still missing as September 
2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't 
come with any additional paid permission for online use of 'private modules'.

EU Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) VAT for telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services
=============================================================================================

As of January 1rst, 2015, telecommunications, broadcasting
and electronic services sold within the European Union
have to be always taxed in the country where the customer
belongs. In order to simplify the application of this EU
directive, the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) registration scheme
allows businesses to make a unique tax declaration.

This module makes it possible by helping with the creation
of the required EU fiscal positions and taxes in order to
automatically apply and record the required taxes.

This module installs a wizard to help setup fiscal positions
and taxes for selling electronic services inside EU.

The wizard lets you select:
 - the EU countries to which you are selling these
   services
 - your national VAT tax for services, to be mapped
   to the target country's tax
 - optionally: a template fiscal position, in order
   to copy the account mapping. Should be your
   existing B2C Intra-EU fiscal position. (defaults
   to no account mapping)
 - optionally: an account to use for collecting the
   tax amounts (defaults to the account used by your
   national VAT tax for services)

It creates the corresponding fiscal positions and taxes,
automatically applicable for EU sales with a customer
in the selected countries.
The wizard can be run again for adding more countries.

Be able to create journals in Odoo to create electronic customer invoices and report then to AFIP (via webserices).
The options available are:

    * Electronic Invoice - Web Service
    * Export Voucher - Web Service
    * Electronic Fiscal Bond - Web Service

In the electronic journals if you validate an invoice this one will be validated in both Odoo and AFIP. This validation is
made at the instant and we recieve and ""approved/approved with observation/rejected"" state from AFIP. If the invoice has
been rejected by AFIP will not be post in the system and a pop up message will be shown with both the error detail (reject reasons)
we recieve and a HINT about what the problem could be.

For auditing and troubleshooting purposes we also add a menu ""Consulit Invoice in AFIP"" that let us to consult invoices previously
sent to AFIP and last number used as support for any possible issues on the sequences synchronization between Odoo and AFIP.

    NOTE: From the Journal's form view we are able to force a sync between the odoo sequences to each of the document types in
    with the last numbers registered in AFIP.

From vendor bills, we have added a functionality that can be configured in the accounting settings to be able to verify
vendor bills in AFIP to check if the vendor bills are real (more information please review the setting description).

Configuration:

1. Go to the Accounting Settings > Argentinian Localization section

    1.1. Configure the AFIP Web Services mode:

    * Testing environment in order to use demo certificates that will be use to test the instance and to make NOT
      real invoices to AFIP. is just for testing. For demo instaces is already pre-defined you will not need to configure
      it (commonly named in AFIP as Homologation environment).
    * Production environment in order to generate real certificates and legal invoices to AFIP,

    1.2. Configure your AFIP Certificate: If you are in a demo instance this one will be have been set by default. If you
         are in production instance just need to go to upload your AFIP Certificate

    1.3. Optionally you can define if you like to be eable to verify vendor bills in AFIP.

2. Create Sales journals that will represent each one of your AFIP POS (Available in AFIP Portal) you want to use in Odoo.

    2.1. Use Documents field is set by default please dont change
    2.2. Set AFIP POS System for one of the electronic ones.

        * Electronic Invoice - Web Service'

        * Export Voucher - Web Service'

    2.3. Set the AFIP POS Number and AFIP POS Address taking into account what you have configured in your AFIP Portal.

    NOTE: You can use the ""Check Available AFIP POS"" button in Journal's form to corroborate the to use to create the journals.

Functional
----------

In some Latinamerica countries, including Argentina and Chile, some accounting transactions like invoices and vendor bills are classified by a document types defined by the government fiscal authorities (In Argentina case AFIP, Chile case SII).

This module is intended to be extended by localizations in order to manage these document types and is an essential information that needs to be displayed in the printed reports and that needs to be easily identified, within the set of invoices as well of account moves.

Each document type have their own rules and sequence number, this last one is integrated with the invoice number and journal sequence in order to be easy for the localization user. In order to support or not this document types a Journal has a new option that lets to use document or not.

Technical
---------

If your localization needs this logic will then need to add this module as dependency and in your localization module extend:

* extend company's _localization_use_documents() method.
* create the data of the document types that exists for the specific country. The document type has a country field

This module add accounting features for the Argentinian localization, which represent the minimal configuration needed for a company  to operate in Argentina and under the AFIP (Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos) regulations and guidelines.

Follow the next configuration steps for Production:

1. Go to your company and configure your VAT number and AFIP Responsibility Type
2. Go to Accounting / Settings and set the Chart of Account that you will like to use.
3. Create your Sale journals taking into account AFIP POS info.

Demo data for testing:

* 3 companies were created, one for each AFIP responsibility type with the respective Chart of Account installed. Choose the company that fix you in order to make tests:

  * (AR) Responsable Inscripto
  * (AR) Exento
  * (AR) Monotributo

* Journal sales configured to Pre printed and Expo invoices in all companies
* Invoices and other documents examples already validated in “(AR) Responsable Inscripto” company
* Partners example for the different responsibility types:

  * ADHOC (IVA Responsable Inscripto)
  * Consejo Municipal Rosario (IVA Sujeto Exento)
  * Gritti (Monotributo)
  * Cerro Castor. IVA Liberado in Zona Franca
  * Expresso (Cliente del Exterior)
  * Odoo (Proveedor del Exterior)

Highlights:

* Chart of account will not be automatically installed, each CoA Template depends on the AFIP Responsibility of the company, you will need to install the CoA for your needs.
* No sales journals will be generated when installing a CoA, you will need to configure your journals manually.
* The Document type will be properly pre selected when creating an invoice depending on the fiscal responsibility of the issuer and receiver of the document and the related journal.
* A CBU account type has been added and also CBU Validation

Key Features
============

1. Fee Definition
    * It is a document to model a fee associated a product during sales / purchases. For example, when you sell a transportation service,
    you may also want to charge the customer for road toll. In such the case, you could define your service and its associated fees as below:
        * Transportation Service X: is a service product
        * Road Toll 1: is another service product that present the Road Toll
        * On the Transportation Service X, select Road Toll 1 as a fee for the Transportation Service X
2. Fee is also a Product, hence, it is seamlessly integrated with Odoo accounting
3. Nested / Recursive Fee structure support. For example,
    * Transportation Service X may have the following fees structure:
        * Dirty Cargo handling Fee at terminals. This fee is also a product in Odoo and may have its own fees defined as below
            * Environment Protection Fee
            * Cargo Stowage fee
        * Road Toll during transportation
    * When calculating fees for the Transportation Service X, this module could offer the following:
        * Direct Fees: which are Dirty Cargo handling Fee and Road Toll
        * Sub fees: Environment Protection Fee, Cargo Stowage
        * Recursive Fees: all the above
4. supplementary fees computation on Sales Quotation
    * A new button ""Compute Supplementary Fees"" provided on the Sales Quotation form. When user click on the button, Odoo will find recursively 
      all the fees associated with the all the products of sales quotation and adding the into the quotation as new lines
    * Upon confirmation of the quotation (to make it a sales order), Odoo will check if Supplementary Fees have been added.
      If not, it will ask user to confirm if Supplementary Fees should be computed and added to the sales order.

============

1. This application allows users to declare dimensions (i.e. Width, Height, Length) and the Stowage Volume on product form view. In case all those 3 dimensions are input, the value of the volume field will be computed automatically according to the dimensions input.
2. The dimentions are availble for both Products and Product Variants.
3. Each product has a switch to allow you to enable ""Dimensions in Name"" feature for the product

It is built for other applications to extend. For example, the application Fleet Stock Picking (to_fleet_stock_picking) depends
on this application to check if the goods loaded on a vehicle (for transportation) does not exceed max. allowed volume / weight.

Notes:
------

* The dimensions and Stowage Volume fields are visibly ONLY when the product type is either Stockable or Consumable

Manage 3-way matching on vendor bills
=====================================

In the manufacturing industry, people often receive the vendor bills before
receiving their purchase, but they don't want to pay the bill until the goods
have been delivered.

The solution to this situation is to create the vendor bill when you get it
(based on ordered quantities) but only pay the invoice when the received
quantities (on the PO lines) match the recorded vendor bill.

This module introduces a ""release to pay"" mechanism that marks for each vendor
bill whether it can be paid or not.

Each vendor bill receives one of the following three states:

    - Yes (The bill can be paid)
    - No (The bill cannot be paid, nothing has been delivered yet)
    - Exception (Received and invoiced quantities differ)

    * CODA v1 support.
    * CODA v2.2 support.
    * Foreign Currency support.
    * Support for all data record types (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9).
    * Parsing & logging of all Transaction Codes and Structured Format
      Communications.
    * Automatic Financial Journal assignment via CODA configuration parameters.
    * Support for multiple Journals per Bank Account Number.
    * Support for multiple statements from different bank accounts in a single
      CODA file.
    * Support for 'parsing only' CODA Bank Accounts (defined as type='info' in
      the CODA Bank Account configuration records).
    * Multi-language CODA parsing, parsing configuration data provided for EN,
      NL, FR.

The machine readable CODA Files are parsed and stored in human readable format in
CODA Bank Statements. Also Bank Statements are generated containing a subset of
the CODA information (only those transaction lines that are required for the
creation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is a
'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the original
CODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by accounting
business processes.

CODA Bank Accounts configured as type 'Info' will only generate CODA Bank Statements.

A removal of one object in the CODA processing results in the removal of the
associated objects. The removal of a CODA File containing multiple Bank
Statements will also remove those associated statements.

Instead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can also
re-import the CODA after updating the OpenERP database with the information that
was missing to allow automatic reconciliation.

Remark on CODA V1 support:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured
communication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA V2.The
description provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the CODA
V2.2 specifications.
If required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA configuration menu.

New extensible file import for Odoo
======================================

Re-implement Odoo's file import system:

* Server side, the previous system forces most of the logic into the
  client which duplicates the effort (between clients), makes the
  import system much harder to use without a client (direct RPC or
  other forms of automation) and makes knowledge about the
  import/export system much harder to gather as it is spread over
  3+ different projects.

* In a more extensible manner, so users and partners can build their
  own front-end to import from other file formats (e.g. OpenDocument
  files) which may be simpler to handle in their work flow or from
  their data production sources.

* In a module, so that administrators and users of Odoo who do not
  need or want an online import can avoid it being available to users.

They come with the following code

  <span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Your <t t-esc=""model_description or 'document'""/></span>
  
It is obviously that they will always produce something like ""Your document"" no matter the language is. In some languages, the expected result will be ""Document Your"".

This module modifies the above mentioned code by removing the ""Your "" to say

.. code:: html

  <span style=""font-size: 10px;""><t t-esc=""model_description or 'document'""/></span>
  
It would be acceptable in all cases to just show something like ""Document"" instead of ""Your document"".

Product Highlights
==================
Affiliate Manager is an Odoo application that extends Odoo's functionality to enable you to run your affiliate program to boost your sales with no effort.

* **Manage Unlimited Affiliates**: No matter how many affiliates you have, the application allows you to manage your affiliate effectively without any pain.
* **Affiliate Program Signup**: Clients can signup your affiliate program within a few clicks. You also can join any of your partners inside your administration panel
* **Automatic Affiliate Code Generation**: Affiliate codes are automatically generated when clients join your affiliate program. On-screen instructions are generated for affiliate quick start.
* **Configurable Cookie Lifetime**: You can define cookie lifetime as long as you want within your configuration panel to meet your business requirements.
* **Configurable Commission Percentage**: You can define your commission base (in percentage against sales order value) for affiliates and change it anytime you want.
* **Minimum Commission Payout**: You can set minimum payout so that an affiliate will not be able to create a payment request if his unpaid commission is less than this amount.
* **Sales Management Integration**: Each quotation/sales order form is added with AffCode field to refer that the order was placed with help of an affiliate. So, you can filter sales orders by this field for better management.
* **Payment & Invoicing Integration**: Seamless integration with Odoo payment & invoicing system. Automatic invoice creation when a commission payment request is approved.

How it works
============
The application allows clients to sign up and join your affiliate program. Once joined, they will be provided with an affiliate code of seven alphanumeric characters to append into your URL in form of http(s)://yourdomain.com/?affcode=xxxxxxx, where the xxxxxxx is the code generated by the system.

Then, the newly signup affiliate can put the formed URL to any of web pages where he want to get potential customers. He can also share the URL to his social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.

When a client follows the URL mentioned above to you site, a cookie will be created and store in the client's browser. If the client buys something from your site before the cookie expiry, a commission will be generated and accounted to your the affiliate code owner.

The affiliate code owner is provided with an affiliate portal so that he can manage their commissions, submit commission payout request, manage paid commission, etc.

POP3/IMAP-compatible servers are supported, included those that require an
encrypted SSL/TLS connection.

This can be used to easily create email-based workflows for many email-enabled Odoo documents, such as:

    * CRM Leads/Opportunities
    * CRM Claims
    * Project Issues
    * Project Tasks

Just install the relevant application, and you can assign any of these document
types (Leads, Project Issues) to your incoming email accounts. New emails will
automatically spawn new documents of the chosen type, so it's a snap to create a
mailbox-to-Odoo integration. Even better: these documents directly act as mini
conversations synchronized by email. You can reply from within Odoo, and the
answers will automatically be collected when they come back, and attached to the
same *conversation* document.

For more specific needs, you may also assign custom-defined actions
(technically: Server Actions) to be triggered for each incoming mail.

Swiss localization
==================
This module defines a chart of account for Switzerland (Swiss PME/KMU 2015), taxes and enables the generation of ISR when you print an invoice or send it by mail.

An ISR will be generated if you specify the information it needs :
    - The bank account you expect to be paid on must be set, and have a valid postal reference.
    - Your invoice must have been set assigned a bank account to receive its payment
      (this can be done manually, but a default value is automatically set if you have defined a bank account).
    - You must have set the postal references of your bank.
    - Your invoice must be in EUR or CHF (as ISRs do not accept other currencies)

The generation of the ISR is automatic if you meet the previous criteria.

Here is how it works:
    - Printing the invoice will trigger the download of two files: the invoice, and its ISR
    - Clicking the 'Send by mail' button will attach two files to your draft mail : the invoice, and the corresponding ISR.

The Problem
===========

In Odoo, a journal entry may contain multiple debit journal items and credit journal items.
However, there is no way for us to identify the countered line(s) of a line and its countered account(s) which may causes some troubles when:

* making reports that require showing up counterparts and countered accounts of a transaction
* identifying types of business transactions. For example, accroding to Vietnam Accounting Standards, revenues from both loan interests and exchange rate profit are also encoded into the account 515. It is impossible to build Cash Flow Statement while it requires to separate those revenues.

* **cr_aml_id**: The credit journal item
* **countered_amt**: the amount that match the counterpart operation of the two journal items above mention

When a counterpart operation is carried out, a new record of the model Journal Item Counterpart will
be created to map a credit journal item with a debit journal item to indicate that the later journal item is a counterpart with a countered amount.

By default, Odoo allow leaves allocation with a total number of leaves allowed. However, it does not control if the allocation for a period of time. For example:
 You can allocate 12 days of Legal Leave but you cannot limit how many leave days for a period of month or year
 
What is does
============

This module improves leave controlability by allowing leave managers to set number of allowed leaves per period for each and every leave type.
For example, they can allocate 12 leave days for an employee but he can limit him to not leave more than 2 days per month.

Many companies order sandwiches, pizzas and other, from usual vendors, for their employees to offer them more facilities.

However lunches management within the company requires proper administration especially when the number of employees or vendors is important.

The “Lunch Order” module has been developed to make this management easier but also to offer employees more tools and usability.

In addition to a full meal and vendor management, this module offers the possibility to display warning and provides quick order selection based on employee’s preferences.

If you want to save your employees' time and avoid them to always have coins in their pockets, this module is essential.

The problem
===========

By default, when a customer of yours comes to return the goods she or he bought from you, you would need to
1. Get rid off the PoS screen and navigate to the Point of Sales order list in the backend to find the corresponding order
2. After validation, you need to open that order in the backend and do return.

There is nothing wrong here but not so productive and waste your time.
If you usually process hundred orders per session which may get you tired,
doing more tasks may lead to some human errors.
    
The solution
============

Instead of going to the backend interface, you keep stay at the PoS screen and do lookup for the order to return then carry out the return process. It's quick and more easier!

Key Features
============

1. Pos Manager can set maximum number of days for goods return in case your company does not accept goods return after a period counting from the date of purchase.
2. PoS users can do return process while staying in the same screen.
3. PoS users will get notified if the return is not within the allowed return period.

The problem
===========

Odoo offers a great module named `Sale Purchase` that support generated a purchase order upon validate a sales order based on
the switch `Purchase Automatically` on product model.

However, this field does not support multi-company environment. In other words, when a product is set with `Purchase Automatically`,
the policy will be applied to all the companies available in the database which is usually not what the users wants.

#. `Company A` sell `Product X` to its customer with `SO0001`, where the `Product X` is set with

   - `Purchase Automatically`: Yes
   - Vendor: Company B, which is another company in the same database
#. Upon `SO0001` confirmation, Odoo automaticaly generate a Purchase Order to Company B (e.g. `PO0001`)
#. In `Company B`, a sales user should create another sales order (e.g. `SO0002`) from `Company A` accordingly.
   Or, the `SO0002` could be generated automatically if you have an Inter-Cpmpany rule that helps generate a sales order from a purchase order in multi-company environment.
#. Upon `SO0002` confirmation, Odoo will try to generate another Purchase Order for the Company B to another
   vendor because the `Product X` is set with `Purchase Automatically`. This is usually NOT what the Company B wants. It is REALLY A PROBLEM! 

Solution
========

This module turn the field `Purchase Automatically` on product modeul into a company-specific field so that the `Company B` will be able turn it off
while the `Company A` will still be able to keep it on.

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_to_stock_backdate,"
The problem
===========
In Odoo, when you carry out stock & inventory operations such as validating a stock transfer, doing inventory adjustment, creating scrap,
Odoo applies the current date and time for the move automatically which is sometimes not what you want. For example,
when you were inputting data for the past operations or when you start a new Odoo implementation that requires data from the past.

The solution
============
This module gives you a chance to input your desired date in the past. The following operations are currently supported with backdate

1. Stock Transfer

   During validation of stock transfers, when you click on Validate button, a new window will be popped out with a datetime field for your input.
   The default value for the field is the current datetime.

2. Inventory Adjustment

   When validating an inventory adjustment, a new window will be popped out with a datetime field for your input.
   The default value for the field is the current datetime, in case you don't want backdate operation.

3. Stock Scrapping

   During validating a scrap from either a stock transfer or a standalone scrap order, a new window will be popped out with a datetime field for your input.
   The default value for the field is the current datetime.

The backdate you input will also be used for accounting entry's date if the product is configured with automated stock valuation.
It supports all available costing methods in Odoo (i.e. Standard Costing, Average Costing, FIFO Costing)

Backdate Operations Control
---------------------------

By default, only users in the ""Inventory / Manager"" group can carry out backdate operations in Inventory application.
Other users must be granted to the access group **Backdate Operations** before she or he can do it.

Known issues
------------

- Since the acounting journal entry's Date field does not contain time, the backdate in accounting may not respect user's timezone,
  and may causes visual discrepancy between stock move's date and accounting date. This is also an issue by Odoo thatcan be reproduced as below
  
  * assume that your timezone is UTC+7
  * validate a stock transfer at your local time between 00:00 and 07:00
  * go to the corresponding accounting journal entry to find its date could be 1 day earlier than the stock transfer's date

In Odoo, with Inventory Valuation enabled, when you transfer goods in/out locations (e.g. Inventory adjustment, Production)
that have Stock Valuation Accounts specified, Odoo will also generate accounting journal entries automatically based on those stock valuation accounts.

However, these Stock Valuation Accounts fields of the stock location model do not respect multi-company enviroment.
In other words, every inventory adjustment move will be encoded into the same company's accounts no matter the company of the adjustment is.

Paypal supports a limited number of currencies that causes problems when your customer pays their invoice in a currency
that does not supported by Paypal.

Here is the list of currencies that supported by Paypal: https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/reference/currency-codes/

What this module does
=====================
When customer carries out payment in a currency that is not supported by PayPal, this module will convert the payment
amount into an amount in a currency (which is configurable) that is supported by Paypal before sending the payment data
to Paypal.

During payment processing and payment notification, this module ensures that the converted amount is equivalent to the original one for full reconciliation.

During reconciliation, the difference due to exchange rate will be encoded into the exchange rate journal

Example

1. Assume that

   * Company currency is VND (Vietnam Dong - đ), which is not a currency supported by Paypal

The problems
============
During closing periods (e.g. end of a fiscal year), reset account balance (carry the balance forward to the next period) for some accounts is a really heavy job. To get it done, accountants would need:

* To have good knowledge of their country's accounting standards on which accounts to be reset
* Calculate balance of the required accounts at the time of closing period. This also brings heavy workload to accountants and may get trouble by human errors

What this application does
==========================
1. Accounting Advisor / Manager can define account balance carry forward rules. For example,
    * 521 -> 511
    * 511 -> 911
    * etc
2. Accountant can create a carry forward document which will automatically
    * load all the applicable rules
    * calculate the balance of all the source accounts, which will be carried forward to the next period for reviews
3. Upon validation of the document, Odoo will create accounting entries for each rule. It also respect the cummulative balance by ordering. For example,
    * Balance of the account 521: 100
    * Balance of the account 511: 550
    * The rules:
        * 521 -> 511
        * 511 -> 911
    * The result:
        * The First journal entry:
            * Debit 100 on 511
            * Credit 100 on 521
        * The Second journal entry:
            * Debit 450 (as the resul of 550-100) on 511
            * Credit 450 on 911
4. (new in Odoo 13): generate balance carry forward entries from selected journal items

Fiscal positions
----------------

When considering taxes to be applied, it is the province where the delivery occurs that matters.
Therefore we decided to implement the most common case in the fiscal positions: delivery is the
responsibility of the vendor and done at the customer location.

Some examples:

1) You have a customer from another province and you deliver to his location.
On the customer, set the fiscal position to his province.

2) You have a customer from another province. However this customer comes to your location
with their truck to pick up products. On the customer, do not set any fiscal position.

3) An international vendor doesn't charge you any tax. Taxes are charged at customs
by the customs broker. On the vendor, set the fiscal position to International.

4) An international vendor charge you your provincial tax. They are registered with your
position.

This is the module to manage the accounting chart for France in Odoo.
========================================================================

This module applies to companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to
companies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte).

This localisation module creates the VAT taxes of type 'tax included' for purchases
(it is notably required when you use the module 'hr_expense'). Beware that these
'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this
module (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'
scenarios in fiscal positions).

This localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland
company sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the
fiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes
and 'service' VAT taxes. We consider that it is too 'heavy' to have this by default
in l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the
configuration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.

Upon validation of a Purchase Order, automaticaly create other Purchase Orders for landed costs that would be allocated to the products
of the first Purchase Order.

Keep track the the landed costs (the amount, where they come from, why you have them, etc)
    
The problems
============

By default, Odoo's Stock Landed Cost application just provides a mean to allocate landed costs to stockable products without any means
for tracking or manage landed cost purchase. For example, when you purchase product A, you may also need to purchase transportation
service product B for another vendor. What would you encode such the information in Odoo? You probably:

1. Create 2 purchase orders
2. Receive the product A
3. Open the second PO to get the cost of the transportation service
4. Create a landed cost to allocate the cost of the transportation service to the product A

After, when you look into the list of thousand lines of landed costs, how you know if the costs are relevant?
Is there anything wrong there? How to know if anything wrong there?

The Solution
============

This application was developed to solve the above mention problems by provide lots of must-have features to ensure that

* you can have some landed cost PO generated automatically when you confirm a PO that may require landed costs to be purchased
* you can create stock landed costs from a landed cost invoice
* everything related to landed costs is trackable. I.e. Landed Cost Adjustments, Landed Costs Purchases, Landed Costs Invoices, original purchase orders, landed costs' account journal items, etc

VAT validation for Partner's VAT numbers.
=========================================

After installing this module, values entered in the VAT field of Partners will
be validated for all supported countries. The country is inferred from the
2-letter country code that prefixes the VAT number, e.g. ``BE0477472701``
will be validated using the Belgian rules.

There are two different levels of VAT number validation:
--------------------------------------------------------
    * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation
      rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and 
      always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,
      or not valid anymore.

    * When the ""VAT VIES Check"" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's
      Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES
      database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently
      allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple
      off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available
      all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the
      requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed
      instead.

Supported countries currently include EU countries, and a few non-EU countries
such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway or Russia. For unsupported countries,
only the country code will be validated.

* New account tags data has been added to use in the similar way of parent view accounts before Odoo 9. For example, accountant now can group all accounts 111xxx using account the tag 111.
* Accounts now link to the tags having corresponding code. E.g. account 1111 and 1112 .... 111x have the same account tag of 111.
* Several analytic tags that is required by financial reports are added
* Add English translations to bring ease for worldwide developers and foreigners doing business in Vietnam. Translations will be loaded upon installation of l10n_multilang module

Vấn đề
======

Hiện tại Odoo có ba hình thức thanh toán:

    * Nhận tiền: Nợ: Tài khoản tiền mặt (ngân hàng) / Có: Tài khoản phải thu
    * Gửi tiền: Nợ: Tài khoản phải trả / Có: Tài khoản tiền mặt (ngân hàng)
    * Chuyển khoản nội bộ: Chuyển khoản nội bộ giữa tài khoản tiền mặt (ngân hàng)

Người dùng không thể tạo nhiều dòng phải trả hoặc phải thu trong một khoản thanh toán.

Giải pháp
=========

Mô-đun này được phát triển để mở rộng Thanh toán trong Odoo:

    * Khi người dùng chọn hình thức thanh toán là Nhận tiền hoặc Gửi tiền bằng Thanh toán, hệ thống sẽ cho phép họ nhập các dòng phải trả hoặc phải thu trong bảng Chi tiết thanh toán
    với các tài khoản và số tiền có thể tùy chỉnh.
     
        * Nếu Chi tiết thanh toán không được thêm bất kỳ dòng nào vào, Odoo sẽ sử dụng các tài khoản mặc định của Odoo để sinh bút toán, ví dụ:             
            * [1] Nợ (Tài khoản phải trả): $100
            * [2] Có (Tiền mặt): $100
     
        * Nếu các dòng Chi tiết thanh toán được thêm vào, Odoo sẽ căn cứ vào các dòng chi tiết thanh toán để sinh bút toán, ví dụ:

            * [1] Nợ (Tài khoản phải trả 1): $ 50
            * [2] Nợ (Tài khoản phải trả 2): $ 30
            * [3] Nợ (Tài khoản phải trả 3): $ 20
            * [5] Có (Tiền mặt): $100

================
Web Domain Field
================

When you define a view you can specify on the relational fields a domain
attribute. This attribute is evaluated as filter to apply when displaying
existing records for selection.

.. code-block:: xml

   <field name=""product_id"" domain=""[('type','=','product')]""/>

The value provided for the domain attribute must be a string representing a
valid Odoo domain. This string is evaluated on the client side in a
restricted context where we can reference as right operand the values of
fields present into the form and a limited set of functions.

In this context it's hard to build complex domain and we are facing to some
limitations as:

 * The syntax to include in your domain a criteria involving values from a
   x2many field is complex.
 * The right side of domain in case of x2many can involve huge amount of ids
   (performance problem).
 * Domains computed by an onchange on an other field are not recomputed when
   you modify the form and don't modify the field triggering the onchange.
 * It's not possible to extend an existing domain. You must completely redefine
   the domain in your specialized addon
 * etc...

In order to mitigate these limitations this new addon allows you to use the
value of a field as domain of an other field in the xml definition of your
view.

.. code-block:: xml

   <field name=""product_id_domain"" invisible=""1""/>
   <field name=""product_id"" domain=""product_id_domain""/>

The field used as domain must provide the domain as a JSON encoded string.

.. code-block:: python

   product_id_domain = fields.Char(
       compute=""_compute_product_id_domain"",
       readonly=True,
       store=False,
   )

   @api.multi
   @api.depends('name')
   def _compute_product_id_domain(self):
       for rec in self:
           rec.product_id_domain = json.dumps(
               [('type', '=', 'product'), ('name', 'like', rec.name)]
           )

Send instant notification messages to the user in live.

This technical module allows you to send instant notification messages from the server to the user in live.
Two kinds of notification are supported.

* Success: Displayed in a `success` theme color flying popup div
* Danger: Displayed in a `danger` theme color flying popup div
* Warning: Displayed in a `warning` theme color flying popup div
* Information: Displayed in a `info` theme color flying popup div
* Default: Displayed in a `default` theme color flying popup div

Installation
============

This module is based on the Instant Messaging Bus. To work properly, the server must be launched in gevent mode.

Usage
=====


To send a notification to the user you just need to call one of the new methods defined on res.users:

.. code-block:: python

   self.env.user.notify_success(message='My success message')

or

.. code-block:: python

   self.env.user.notify_danger(message='My danger message')

or

.. code-block:: python

   self.env.user.notify_warning(message='My warning message')

or

.. code-block:: python

   self.env.user.notify_info(message='My information message')

or

.. code-block:: python

   self.env.user.notify_default(message='My default message')

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/web/13.0/web_notify/static/description/notifications_screenshot.png
   :scale: 80 %
   :alt: Sample notifications

You can test the behaviour of the notifications by installing this module in a demo database.
Access the users form through Settings -> Users & Companies. You'll see a tab called ""Test web notify"", here you'll find two buttons that'll allow you test the module.

+--------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Optionally you can declare a custom template, which will be used to render the
timeline items. You have to name the template 'timeline-item'.
These are the variables available in template rendering:

* ``record``: to access the fields values selected in the timeline definition.
* ``field_utils``: used to format and parse values (see available functions in ``web.field_utils``).

You also need to declare the view in an action window of the involved model.

Example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
    <odoo>
        <record id=""view_task_timeline"" model=""ir.ui.view"">
            <field name=""model"">project.task</field>
            <field name=""type"">timeline</field>
            <field name=""arch"" type=""xml"">
                <timeline date_start=""date_assign""
                          date_stop=""date_end""
                          string=""Tasks""
                          default_group_by=""user_id""
                          event_open_popup=""true""
                          zoomKey=""ctrlKey""
                          colors=""#ec7063:user_id == false;#2ecb71:kanban_state=='done';""
                          dependency_arrow=""task_dependency_ids"">
                    <field name=""user_id""/>
                    <templates>
                        <div t-name=""timeline-item"">
                            <div t-esc=""record.display_name""/>
                            Assigned to:
                            <span t-esc=""record.user_id[1]""/>
                        </div>
                    </templates>
                </timeline>
            </field>
        </record>

        <record id=""project.action_view_task"" model=""ir.actions.act_window"">
            <field name=""view_mode"">kanban,tree,form,calendar,gantt,timeline,graph</field>
        </record>
    </odoo>

Usage
=====

For accessing the timeline view, you have to click on the button with the clock
icon in the view switcher. The first time you access to it, the timeline window
is zoomed to fit all the current elements, the same as when you perform a
search, filter or group by operation.

You can use the mouse scroll to zoom in or out in the timeline, and click on
any free area and drag for panning the view in that direction.

The records of your model will be shown as rectangles whose widths are the
duration of the event according our definition. You can select them clicking
on this rectangle. You can also use Ctrl or Shift keys for adding discrete
or range selections. Selected records are hightlighted with a different color
(but the difference will be more noticeable depending on the background color).
Once selected, you can drag and move the selected records across the timeline.

When a record is selected, a red cross button appears on the upper left corner
that allows to remove that record. This doesn't work for multiple records
although they were selected.

Records are grouped in different blocks depending on the group by criteria
selected (if none is specified, then the default group by is applied).
Dragging a record from one block to another change the corresponding field to
the value that represents the block. You can also click on the group name to
edit the involved record directly.

Double-click on the record to edit it. Double-click in open area to create a
new record with the group and start date linked to the area you clicked in.
By holding the Ctrl key and dragging left to right, you can create a new record
with the dragged start and end date.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Implement a more efficient way of refreshing timeline after a record update;
* Make `attrs` attribute work;
* Make action attributes work (create, edit, delete) like in form and tree views.

Usage
=====

The following keyboard shortcuts are implemented:

* Navigate app search results - Arrow keys
* Choose app result - ``Enter``
* ``Esc`` to close app drawer

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* To view the full experience in a device, the page must be loaded with the
  device screen size. This means that, if you change the size of your browser,
  you should reload the web client to get the full experience for that
  new size. This is Odoo's own limitation.
* App navigation with keyboard.
* Handle long titles on forms in a better way
* Standard sticky headers seems to not work properly on iOS Safari/Chrome (see #1626).

More powerful and easy to use search, especially for related fields.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Open *Filters* in a search view
* Select any relational field
* Select operator `is equal to` or `is not equal to`
* The text field changes to a relational selection field where you
  can search for the record in question
* Click *Apply*

To search for properties of linked records (ie invoices for customers
with a credit limit higher than X):

* Open *Filters* in a search view
* Select *Add Advanced Filter*
* Edit the advanced filter
* Click *Save*

Note that you can stack searching for properties: Simply add another
advanced search in the selection search window. You can do
this indefinetely, so it is possible to search for moves belonging
to a journal which has a user who is member of a certain group etc.

Note also the domain dialog offers an editable preview in debug mode:
  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/web/13.0/web_advanced_search/static/img/debug_mode.png

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Improvements to the ``domain`` widget, not exclusively related to this addon:

* Use relational widgets when filtering a relational field
* Allow to filter field names

Improvements to the search view in this addon:

* Use widgets ``one2many_tags`` when searching ``one2many`` fields
* Use widgets ``many2many_tags`` when searching ``many2many`` fields
* Allow to edit current full search using the advanced domain editor

Issues:

* Grouped totals can show incorrect values. See https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/47950

Changelog
=========

11.0.1.0.2 (2018-10-31)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix initialization of 1st domain node

  Sometime the dialog is not ready yet, like on EE version.
  Hence when you inject the 1st domain node
  the dialog must be already opened.

  [simahawk]


11.0.1.0.1 (2018-09-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix `undefined` in x2m fields

  Before this patch, when searching with the ""equals to"" operator in any
  x2many field, the searched parameter was always `undefined`.

  The problem was that the underlying field manager implementation was
  treating those fields as x2many, while the widget used was the `one2many`
  one.

  This patch simply mocks the underlying fake record to make think that
  any relational field is always a `one2many`. This sets all pieces in
  place and makes the field manager work as expected, and thus you can
  search as expected too.

* Make linter happy

  [Yajo]


11.0.1.0.0 (2018-07-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Rename, refactor, migrate to v11

=============

If you want to set dialog boxes maximized by default, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings -> Technical -> Parameters -> System Parameters*
#. Add a new record with the text *web_dialog_size.default_maximize* in
    the *Key* field and the text *True* in the *Value* field

Edit..."" entries from many2one drop down. You can also change default number of
proposition appearing in the drop-down. Or prevent the dialog box poping in
case of validation error.

If not specified, the module will avoid proposing any of the create options
if the current user has no permission rights to create the related object.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

in the field's options dict

  Whether to display the many2one dialog in case of validation error.

``limit`` *int* (Default: openerp default value is ``7``)

  Number of displayed record in drop-down panel

``search_more`` *boolean*

- web_m2x_options.create_edit: False
- web_m2x_options.m2o_dialog: False
- web_m2x_options.limit: 10
- web_m2x_options.search_more: True


Example
~~~~~~~

Your XML form view definition could contain::

    ...
    <field name=""partner_id"" options=""{'limit': 10, 'create': false, 'create_edit': false, 'search_more':true 'field_color':'state', 'colors':{'active':'green'}}""/>
    ...

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Double check that you have no inherited view that remove ``options`` you set on a field !
If nothing works, add a debugger in the first line of ``_search method`` and enable debug mode in Odoo. When you write something in a many2one field, javascript debugger should pause. If not verify your installation.

- Instead of making the tags rectangle clickable, I think it's better to put the text as a clickable link, so we will get a consistent behaviour/aspect with other clickable elements (many2one...).
- In edit mode, it would be great to add an icon like the one on many2one fields to allow to open the many2many in a popup window.
- Include this feature as a configurable option via parameter to have this behaviour by default in all many2many tags.

`Bokeh <https://bokeh.pydata.org>`__ is a Python interactive visualization
library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to
provide elegant, concise construction of basic exploratory and advanced
custom graphics in the style of D3.js, but also deliver this capability with
high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh
can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive
plots, dashboards, and data applications.

If you want to see some samples of bokeh's capabilities follow this `link
<https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html>`_.

Installation
============

You need to install the python bokeh library::

    pip3 install bokeh==1.1.0

Usage
=====

To insert a Bokeh chart in a view proceed as follows:

#. Declare a text computed field like this::

    bokeh_chart = fields.Text(
        string='Bokeh Chart',
        compute='_compute_bokeh_chart',
    )

#. In its computed method do::

    def _compute_bokeh_chart(self):
        for rec in self:
            # Design your bokeh figure:
            p = figure()  # import that as `from bokeh.plotting import figure`
            line = p.line([0, 2], [1, 8], line_width=5)
            # (...)
            # fill the record field with both markup and the script of a chart.
            script, div = components(p)
            rec.bokeh_chart = '%s%s' % (div, script)

#. In the view, add something like this wherever you want to display your
   bokeh chart::

    <div>
        <field name=""bokeh_chart"" widget=""bokeh_chart"" nolabel=""1""/>
    </div>

Extend URL widget features to ease customization of anchor's text.

By default, the URL widget will show the plain URL.
You can specify an attribute to provide a static label too.

With this module, you can use a field for link's inner text using attribute
'text_field'. You can also add a prefix to the link using attribute
'prefix_name'.

Until 13.0 this functionality was separated in modules 'web_widget_url_advanced'
and 'web_widget_prefixed_url'

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

Use `url` widget as you do usually, then add an extra parameter `text_field`
to indicate which field (present in the view already) must be used for the anchor text.


.. code-block:: xml

    <field name=""some_url"" widget=""url"" text_field=""another_field"" />

M2O fields are supported: `display_name` is used automatically.


For example, in the partner form,
if you want to display the website link with partner's name as anchor you can do:


.. code-block:: xml

    <field name=""website"" widget=""url"" text_field=""name"" placeholder=""e.g. www.odoo.com""/>

This is going to change the rendering from

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/web/13.0/web_widget_url_advanced/static/description/before.png


to

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/web/13.0/web_widget_url_advanced/static/description/after.png

Or user can add any hyperlink text using 'prefix_name' attribute

.. code-block:: xml

    <field name=""skype_name"" widget=""url"" 'prefix_name': 'skype'/>

both can be applied inside the options attribute too:

.. code-block:: xml

    <field name=""skype_name"" widget=""url"" options=""{'prefix_name': 'skype'}""/>

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* ``<field text_field=""foo""/>`` is not supported in tree views.

Adds support for computed measures on the pivot view.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

Go to pivot view and click on the ""Measures"" menu, you will see
a new option called 'Computed Measure'.

You have the follow options to create a 'computed measure':
 - Measure 1: Used in 'operation formula' as 'm1'
 - Measure 2: Used in 'operation formula' as 'm2'
 - Operation: The formula
    - Sum: m1 + m2
    - Sub: m1 - m2
    - Mult: m1 * m2
    - Div: m1 / m2 (Format: Float)
    - Perc m1 / m2 (Format: Percentage)
    - Custom: Special option only visible in debug mode to write a custom formula.
 - Name: The name of the new measure (emtpy = auto-generated)
 - Format: How will the value be printed
    - Integer
    - Float
    - Percentage (value * 100)
 - Formula*: Custom operation formula
    These formula is evaluated using 'PY.eval'

These computed measures can be mixed (You can reuse it to make new computed measures) and saved as favorites.

Notice that ""measures/computed measures"" involved in an active 'computed measure'
can't be deactivated until you have deactivate the 'computed measure'.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

#. Add support to define a style for a computed measure (ex. colored)

This module allows to show an x2many field with 3-tuples
($x_value, $y_value, $value) in a table

+-----------+-------------+-------------+
|           | $x_value1   | $x_value2   |
+===========+=============+=============+
| $y_value1 | $value(1/1) | $value(2/1) |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+
| $y_value2 | $value(1/2) | $value(2/2) |
+-----------+-------------+-------------+

where `value(n/n)` is editable.

An example use case would be: Select some projects and some employees so that
a manager can easily fill in the planned_hours for one task per employee. The
result could look like this:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/web/12.0/web_widget_x2many_2d_matrix/static/description/screenshot.png
    :alt: Screenshot

The beauty of this is that you have an arbitrary amount of columns with this
widget, trying to get this in standard x2many lists involves some quite ugly
hacks.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

Use this widget by saying::

<field name=""my_field"" widget=""x2many_2d_matrix"" />

This assumes that my_field refers to a model with the fields `x`, `y` and
`value`. If your fields are named differently, pass the correct names as
attributes:

.. code-block:: xml

    <field name=""my_field"" widget=""x2many_2d_matrix"" field_x_axis=""my_field1"" field_y_axis=""my_field2"" field_value=""my_field3"">
        <tree>
            <field name=""my_field""/>
            <field name=""my_field1""/>
            <field name=""my_field2""/>
            <field name=""my_field3""/>
        </tree>
    </field>

You can pass the following parameters:

field_x_axis
    The field that indicates the x value of a point
field_y_axis
    The field that indicates the y value of a point
field_label_x_axis
    Use another field to display in the table header
field_label_y_axis
    Use another field to display in the table header
field_value
    Show this field as value
show_row_totals
    If field_value is a numeric field, it indicates if you want to calculate
    row totals. True by default
show_column_totals
    If field_value is a numeric field, it indicates if you want to calculate
    column totals. True by default

Example
~~~~~~~

You need a data structure already filled with values. Let's assume we want to
use this widget in a wizard that lets the user fill in planned hours for one
task per project per user. In this case, we can use ``project.task`` as our
data model and point to it from our wizard. The crucial part is that we fill
the field in the default function:

.. code-block:: python

    from odoo import fields, models

    class MyWizard(models.TransientModel):
        _name = 'my.wizard'

        def _default_task_ids(self):
            # your list of project should come from the context, some selection
            # in a previous wizard or wherever else
            projects = self.env['project.project'].browse([1, 2, 3])
            # same with users
            users = self.env['res.users'].browse([1, 2, 3])
            return [
                (0, 0, {
                    'name': 'Sample task name',
                    'project_id': p.id,
                    'user_id': u.id,
                    'planned_hours': 0,
                    'message_needaction': False,
                    'date_deadline': fields.Date.today(),
                })
                # if the project doesn't have a task for the user,
                # create a new one
                if not p.task_ids.filtered(lambda x: x.user_id == u) else
                # otherwise, return the task
                (4, p.task_ids.filtered(lambda x: x.user_id == u)[0].id)
                for p in projects
                for u in users
            ]

        task_ids = fields.Many2many('project.task', default=_default_task_ids)

Now in our wizard, we can use:

.. code-block:: xml

    <field name=""task_ids"" widget=""x2many_2d_matrix"" field_x_axis=""project_id"" field_y_axis=""user_id"" field_value=""planned_hours"">
        <tree>
            <field name=""task_ids""/>
            <field name=""project_id""/>
            <field name=""user_id""/>
            <field name=""planned_hours""/>
        </tree>
    </field>

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Support extra attributes on each field cell via `field_extra_attrs` param.
  We could set a cell as not editable, required or readonly for instance.
  The `readonly` case will also give the ability
  to click on m2o to open related records.

* Support limit total records in the matrix. Ref: https://github.com/OCA/web/issues/901

* Support cell traversal through keyboard arrows.

* Entering the widget from behind by pressing ``Shift+TAB`` in your keyboard
  will enter into the 1st cell until https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/26490
  is merged.

* Support extra invisible fields inside each cell.

* Support kanban mode. Current behaviour forces list mode.

Make Odoo an installable Progressive Web Application.

Progressive Web Apps provide an installable, app-like experience on desktop and mobile that are built and delivered directly via the web.
They're web apps that are fast and reliable. And most importantly, they're web apps that work in any browser.
If you're building a web app today, you're already on the path towards building a Progressive Web App.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Installation
============

After having installed this module, browsing your odoo on mobile you will be able to install it as a PWA.

It is strongly recommended to use this module with a responsive layout, like the one provided by web_responsive.

This module is intended to be used by Odoo back-end users (employees).

When a Progressive Web App is installed, it looks and behaves like all of the other installed apps.
It launches from the same place that other apps launch. It runs in an app without an address bar or other browser UI.
And like all other installed apps, it's a top level app in the task switcher.

In Chrome, a Progressive Web App can either be installed through the three-dot context menu.

This module also provides a ""Install PWA"" link in Odoo user menu.

Configuration

This module aims to add support for dynamically coloring fields in tree view
according to data in the record.

Features
========

* Add attribute ``bg_color`` on field's ``options`` to color background of a cell in tree view
* Add attribute ``fg_color`` on field's ``options`` to change text color of a cell in tree view

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

* In the tree view declaration, put ``options='{""bg_color"": ""red: customer==True""}`` attribute in the ``field`` tag::

    ...
    <field name=""arch"" type=""xml"">
        <tree string=""View name"">
            ...
            <field name=""name"" options='{""bg_color"": ""red: customer == True""}'/>
            ...
        </tree>
    </field>
    ...

    With this example, column which renders 'name' field will have its background colored in red.

* In the tree view declaration, put ``options='{""fg_color"": ""white:customer == True""}'`` attribute in the ``field`` tag::

    ...
    <field name=""arch"" type=""xml"">
        <tree string=""View name"">
            ...
            <field name=""name"" options='{""fg_color"": ""white:customer == True""}'/>
            ...
        </tree>
    </field>
    ...

    With this example, column which renders 'name' field will have its text colored in white on a customer records.

* If you want to use more than one color, you can split the attributes using ';':

.. code::

   options='{""fg_color"": ""red:red_color == True; green:green_color == True""}'

Example:

.. code:: xml

   ...
    <field name=""arch"" type=""xml"">
        <tree string=""View name"">
            ...
            <field name=""name"" options='{""fg_color"": ""red:red_color == True; green:green_color == True""}'/>
            ...
        </tree>
    </field>
    ...

    With this example, the content of the field named `my_color` will be used to
    populate the `my_color` CSS value. Use a function field to return whichever
    color you want depending on the other record values. Note that this
    overrides the rest of `colors` attributes, and that you need the tree
    to load your field in the first place by adding it as invisible field.

**Note that you should always use single quotes for fields' ``options`` and wrap nested values in double quotes since ``options`` is a JSON object.**

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Before version 13.0, this module had a feature allowing to change the color of
  a line depending on a field, using a ``colors`` attribute with the name of the
  field on the ``<tree>`` element. Since 13.0, the ``colors`` attribute is no
  longer in the RelaxNG schema of the tree view, so we can't use it anymore.
  This feature has then been dropped, but could be reimplement in another way.

Since v11 introduced the new domain editor widget it's not possible to edit
the selected records from the current domain.

This module reintroduces that dialog to complement the current widget with the
powerful search engine of Odoo.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

In any view with a domain field widget and model, but we'll make the example
with a user filter:

#. Enter debug mode.
#. Go to the *Debug menu* and select the option *Manage Filters*
#. Create a new one
#. Put a name to the filter and select a model (e.g.: Contact)
#. Click on the record selection button and a list dialog opens. There you can
   either:

  * Select individual records: those ids will be added to the domain.
  * Set filters that will be applied to the domain and select all the records
    to add it as a new filter.
  * Set groups that will be converted into search filters, select all the
    records and those unfolded groups will be set as filters to.

You can still edit the filter with Odoo's widget after that.

===============================================
This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and
will automatically create Odoo users for them on the fly.

**Note:** This module only work on servers that have Python's ``python-ldap`` module installed.

Configuration:
--------------
After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the
General Settings menu. Different companies may have different
LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique
in Odoo, even across multiple companies).

Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by
simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.
This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master
LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to
authenticate it.

Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting
it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.

For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf
manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.

Security Considerations:
------------------------
Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the LDAP server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the
password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.

Odoo does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).

It is also possible to have local Odoo users in the database along with
LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).

Here is how it works:
---------------------
    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local Odoo
      database;
    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local
      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;

As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local Odoo database
(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is
queried to do the authentication.

Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is
encrypted.

User Template:
--------------
In the LDAP configuration on the General Settings, it is possible to select a *User
Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users
whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This
allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.

**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be
         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting
         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You
         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to
         login once with a valid LDAP user, let Odoo create a blank local
         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new
         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups

===================================================

Add the financial reports to Mexican Electronic Invoice

- COA
- Trial Balance
- Journal Items

Add other operative reports like DIOT.

- DIOT

Known leak of features:

- Save the generated xml in order to make available an history of Fiscal declared documents.
- Unit tests to increase the coverage of this module and avoid regressions in the future.

Notes:
------

  - In the taxes could be set the account `Base Tax Received Account` that is the
    account that will be set on lines created in cash basis journal entry and
    used to keep track of the tax base amount, this account is not considered in
    the Mexican reports.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, it is strongly recommended your chart of account depends of the l10n_mx data and structure,
you can set this afterwards if you CoA do not depends of what l10n_mx does, but you will need extra manual work.

==================================================

Ce module permet de générer le fichier FEC tel que définit par `l'arrêté du 29
Juillet 2013 <http://legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2013/7/29/BUDE1315492A/jo/texte>`
portant modification des dispositions de l'article A. 47 A-1 du
livre des procédures fiscales.

Cet arrêté prévoit l'obligation pour les sociétés ayant une comptabilité
informatisée de pouvoir fournir à l'administration fiscale un fichier
regroupant l'ensemble des écritures comptables de l'exercice. Le format de ce
fichier, appelé *FEC*, est définit dans l'arrêté.

Le détail du format du FEC est spécifié dans le bulletin officiel des finances publiques `BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213 <http://bofip.impots.gouv.fr/bofip/ext/pdf/createPdfWithAnnexePermalien/BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213.pdf?doc=9028-PGP&identifiant=BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213>` du 13 Décembre 2013. Ce module implémente le fichier
FEC au format texte et non au format XML, car le format texte sera facilement
lisible et vérifiable par le comptable en utilisant un tableur.

La structure du fichier FEC généré par ce module a été vérifiée avec le logiciel
*Test Compta Demat* version 1_00_05 disponible sur
`le site de la direction générale des finances publiques <http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgfip/outil-test-des-fichiers-des-ecritures-comptables-fec>`
en utilisant une base de donnée Odoo réelle.

Configuration
=============

Aucune configuration n'est nécessaire.

Utilisation
===========

Pour générer le *FEC*, allez dans le menu *Accounting > Reporting > French Statements > FEC* qui va démarrer l'assistant de génération du FEC.

Chart of account:
-----------------

The tree of the CoA is done using account groups, all the accounts with move
are available as groups but only the more common ones are available as actual
accounts, if you want to create a new one use the group of accounts as
reference.

**Nota:**
---------

**RELACIÓN ENTRE EL PCGE Y LA LEGISLACIÓN TRIBUTARIA:**

Este PCGE ha sido preparado como una herramienta de carácter contable, para acumular información que 
requiere ser expuesta en el cuerpo de los estados financieros o en las notas a dichos estados. Esa acumulación se 
efectúa en los libros o registros contables, cuya denominación y naturaleza depende de las actividades que se 
efectúen, y que permiten acciones de verificación, control y seguimiento. Las NIIF completas y la NIIF PYMES no
contienen prescripciones sobre teneduría de libros, y consecuentemente, sobre los libros y otros registros 
de naturaleza contable. Por otro lado, si bien es cierto la contabilidad es también un insumo, dentro de otros, para 
labores de cumplimiento tributario, este PCGE no ha sido elaborado para satisfacer prescripciones tributarias ni su 
verificación. No obstante ello, donde no hubo oposición entre la contabilidad financiera prescrita por las NIIF y
la legislación tributaria, este PCGE ha incluido subcuentas, divisionarias y sub divisionarias, para
distinguir componentes con validez tributaria, dentro del conjunto de componentes que corresponden a una
perspectiva contable íntegramente. Por lo tanto, este PCGE no debe ser considerado en ningún aspecto
como una guía con propósitos distintos del contable.",,

------------------

### Infinitely flexible. Incredibly easy to use.


Odoo's collaborative and realtime <a href=""https://www.odoo.com/page/project-management"">open source project management</a>
helps your team get work done. Keep track of everything, from the big picture
to the minute details, from the customer contract to the billing.

Designed to fit your own process
--------------------------------

Organize projects around your own processes. Work on tasks and issues using the
kanban view, schedule tasks using the gantt chart and control deadlines in the
calendar view. Every project may have it's own stages allowing teams to
optimize their job.

Easy to use
-----------

Get organized as fast as you can think. The easy-to-use interface takes no time
to learn, and every action is instantaneous, so there’s nothing standing
between you and your sweet productive flow.

Work Together
-------------

### Real time chats, document sharing, email integration

Use open chatter to communicate with your team or customers and share comments
and documents on tasks and issues. Integrate discussion fast with the email
integration.

Talk to others users or customers with the website live chat feature.

Collaborative Writing
---------------------

### The power of etherpad, inside your tasks

Collaboratively edit the same specifications or meeting minutes right inside
the application. The incorporated etherpad feature allows several people to
work on the same tasks, at the same time.

This is very efficient for scrum meetings, meeting minutes or complex
specifications. Every user has their own color and you can replay the whole
creation of the content.

Get Work Done
-------------

Get alerts on followed events to stay up to date with what interests you. Use
instant green/red visual indicators to scan through what has been done and what
requires your attention.

Timesheets, Contracts & Invoicing
---------------------------------

Projects are automatically integrated with customer contracts allowing you to
invoice based on time & materials and record timesheets easily.

Track Issues
------------

Single out the issues that arise in a project in order to have a better focus
on resolving them. Integrate customer interaction on every issue and get
accurate reports on your team's performance.
